# Covidash

Covidash is an open source, community driven COVID-19 dashboard that not only shows the daily statistics of the growing pandemic, but also some forecasts for the growth of the pandemic. 

The forecasts are generated by a Facebook Prophet Model, with the MAPE consistently remaining below 5% for all countries.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- The program will run without any issues on any computer, but for a smooth performance, we recommend a system with atleast 4 GB of memory, and atleast 2 CPU cores.
- You must have either Python or Docker(recommended) installed. 
- You must have git installed to clone this repository, or you can just download the zip file.

### Basic Setup
#### 1. If you have Docker installed
- Run the following commands on a UNIX based system
```
chmod +x deploy.sh
./deploy.sh
```
- Open a browser and navigate to 0.0.0.0:8050, and you will see the dashboard

#### 2. If you have only Python installed
- Run the following commands on a UNIX based system to get the python environment ready. We are using venv here, as its very simple to get started with
```
python3 -m venv env # Use python instead of python3 if the command throws an error
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- Navigate to the web_app directory, and start the app with the following commands
```
cd src/web_app/
gunicorn --bind :8050 --workers 2 --threads 8 app:server # Change the number of workers and threads to your liking
```
- Open a browser and navigate to 0.0.0.0:8050, and you will see the dashboard
### TODO
- Add setup instructions for Windows distributions
- Add the basic usage instructions
